<p><strong>GreenCoinX Inc</strong> is the developer of GreenCoinX (crypto currency symbol XGC) which is the worldâ€™s first identifiable crypto currency. GreenCoinX identifies users and facilitates the collection of user defined optional taxes by worldwide governments. By eliminating anonymity, GreenCoinX has removed the biggest barrier to widespread adoption of crypto currency.</p>

<p>GreenCoinX Inc is an affiliated company of GreenBank Capital Inc (CSE:GBC), a merchant bank publicly listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange. For more information on GreenBank please see <a href="http://www.greenbankcapitalinc.com/" target="_blank">www.GreenBankCapitalInc.com</a></p>

<p>GreenCoinX has addressed and resolved the three issues that have prevented any crypto currency from being accepted worldwide:
<ol>
<li><strong>Identification</strong> it is the first and only identifiable crypto currency in the world</li>

<li><strong>Currency Stability</strong> it has a detailed plan to establish a Treasury function to keep currency volatility within an acceptable band</li>

<li><strong>Longevity</strong> it has established a non-profit foundation that will resolve the problem of long term block chain mining rewards</li>
</ol>
</p> 
<p>Governments will partner with GreenCoinX to define what tax, "<strong>Know Your Client</strong>", and currency control requirements they require in their jurisdiction, and XGC will be modified accordingly on a country by country basis for free.</p>
